# Why do we need blockchain technology?
The first practical use-case of blockchain technology can be traced back to early 2008, a period at which the world was going through a miserable financial crisis. During that period, someone with an alias: “Satoshi Nakamoto”, about whom no one really knows if it was a person or a group, noticed the danger of the centralized nature of our financial system. Back then, to transfer money or even carry out a simple transaction, the assistance of a third party (like a bank or Paypal) was required.

There was a ridiculous level of power in the hands of the centralized third parties. For instance, They had all your information.

They had the power to freeze your accounts.

You had no other choice but to trust the system.

In place of this centralized system, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a decentralized peer-to-peer financial system involving a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin and Blockchain was the basic technology behind Bitcoin.

While traders only focus on the million dollar gains they could possibly realize, they always overlook the basic technology behind cryptocurrency. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and Altcoins, which makes storing valuables possible. Blockchain stores data in a distributed ledger which can be potentially accessed and updated in a secure way by billions of people. Blockchain technology will soon go beyond the digital currency movement and begin to influence almost every sector. From real estate to entertainment, a lot of startups as well as existing businesses continue to integrate blockchain into their business models. The methods of governing some countries and their democratic processes will be influenced as well by the incoming wave of blockchain.

Electoral fraud and votes hacking had been a major concern for us over the years. Advocates of Blockchain are confident that introducing a public ledger voting system could provide an unhackable system for governments while also ensuring that votes get counted faster.
