# BlockChain


# <h1 align="center">History</h1>
In 1991, Dr. W. Scott Stornetta published a whitepaper with his co-author Dr. Stuart Haber to introduce `‘BlockChain’`. 

The term blockchain can be defined as a decentralised, cryptic database on which digital transactions take place.

 A structure which was almost the same as Blockchain was mentioned in a research paper by Haber and Stornetta with the title: “How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document” in 1991.

The next and certainly the most important Blockchain innovation was the ``Bitcoin``. Satoshi Nakamoto published a white-paper in 2008, titled `“Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System”`. The paper mentioned that with peer-to-peer networking, there will be a solution to the problem of double spending in digital currency. The paper was aimed at building a peer-to-peer digital currency version which would enable people to spend it directly without involving a financial institution. It was a great development that allowed the user to make direct transactions without relying on a third party.

# First Generation Blockchain Technology
In order to understand the 1st Generation blockchain technology, it is essential to observe Bitcoin’s Blockchain. With the use of blockchain technology, Bitcoin became the first successful digital currency in the whole world.
This was achieved through the 1st Generation blockchain technology.
# Now, why Bitcoin was created?

The founder of Bitcoin, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto planned to remove Third-Party verification and intended to create a trustless payment platform with transactions that can not be reversed. Such a system is helpful in private transactions, receiving and providing financial aid to people residing in unstable countries with collapsing economies. Bitcoin is a currency with no borders.

Imagine you did a work-from-home internship for a startup in the USA and you got paid through Paypal. Paypal will charge you a transaction fee of 2.5 to 5%. At that moment, you have USD in you Paypal account, which needs to be converted. The standard conversion rate of Paypal or other converters is usually Rs. 2 to 3/USD less than the actual rate. When you finally have the SGP currency in your bank account, you will be charged by your bank once your balance is less than the “Minimum Balance Criterion”. This entire process would take a minimum of 3-5 business days.

For instance, Alex wants to send $100 to Bob. However, he would have to ignore a trusted third party like a Bank or Financial institution in order to enable Bob receive it earlier. A transaction charge of 2% is deducted from the total amount and Bob receives $98 only. Now the 2% charged might appear like a very little amount. However, imagine if you sent $100,000 rather than $100, then the transaction fees will also increase to $2,000, which is a huge amount. According to a record from SNL Financial and CNNMoney, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, they earned more than $6 billion from these transaction charges.

Most of these expenses are recorded under Third-Party/Broker Fees, which you pay to a trusted third party (Paypal and your Bank) for carrying out your transactions.

On the contrary, if the startup you worked for had paid you in Bitcoin, there would have been a very minute fee (less than the above scenario) and the whole transaction would have been completed within an hour. You would have directly received Bitcoin in your wallet.

# Second Generation Blockchain.
Second generation blockchains started the use of maintaining assets in general by a blockchain. In this generation, anyone can issue shares on the blockchain. Ethereum is a good example of a second generation blockchain. Ethereum is based on applying authoritative rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions, taking both the state of a blockchain and a transaction for that blockchain, which in turn results into a new state.

# But what is a smart contract ?
A smart contract is a coded contract that is subsequently uploaded to a blockchain. Whenever a contract is executed in a blockchain, every network node runs it and then uploads it to the blockchain.
2nd Generation Blockchain Technology is actually an upgrade; it is more than a simple digital currency. It has grown into a platform for creating decentralised applications which can be applied into many aspects of our daily lives to reduce cost and improve efficiency.

# Third Generation Blockchain Technology.
Third generation blockchains present themselves as blockchains that can service massive amounts of people and self-govern. Third generation blockchains have self-governance at their core. E.g. Steem.

Third generation blockchains are the most useful where contracts, agreements and information flow are concerned. What third generation blockchains are capable of doing is to connect two or more blockchains like a computer network connection.

Third generation blockchains can also function in layers. That way, one layer could handle contracts, one layer handles transactions and another layer passes secure data among blockchains. This is aimed at securing the blockchain and never slowing it down or compromising its performance. Blockchains like Ethereum gets compromised that way. For every time a new user or token launches on the Ethereum blockchain, it compromises the blockchain speed and slows it down to manage the increasing requests and actions the blockchain needs to process or validate.
